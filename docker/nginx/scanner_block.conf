# Scanner and bot blocking rules
# This file contains additional security configurations

# Block common scanner/bot user agents using map (defined in server block)
# The $is_scanner variable is set in the server configuration

# Geo-blocking example (uncomment and customize if needed):
# geo $blocked_country {
#     default 0;
#     # Block specific IP ranges (example: known bot networks)
#     # 1.2.3.0/24 1;
# }

# Known malicious IP ranges (update periodically)
# These are example ranges - you should update with current threat intelligence
# deny 0.0.0.0/8;          # "This" network
# deny 10.0.0.0/8;         # Private (uncomment if external-only)
# deny 127.0.0.0/8;        # Loopback (uncomment if external-only)
# deny 169.254.0.0/16;     # Link-local
# deny 224.0.0.0/4;        # Multicast
# deny 240.0.0.0/4;        # Reserved

# Rate limit aggressive bots more strictly
# This is handled in the main server config with limit_req zones
